First we should know about foundamental angular such as
decorators @Input and @Output
@input and @Output this almost all same , like @Input and @Output this for 
Send per component to other Components, in angular we can
sharing per component there 3 ways such as use 
@Input and @Output and other simple use Variable template '#'
this about decorators sending data to other Components

[src] this is data binding
{{}} this is interpolation 
() this is expresion of ( = += ++ etc.)
expresion no side effect 
expression Fast, simple, Idempotent

for hidden the empty data in the other data in looping we can use 
*ngIf="data?.name" or [hidden]="!data?.name"  so data is empty will hidden

here I'm use ngSwitch for take time ,  (ngSwitchCase)="8:00 am" this will display early mornings
anf (ngSwitchCase)="10:00 am" this will display middle days and etch. so you can use
ngSwitch focus to time what you want to display in interface take
in database but want to display morning only
and 
I will givr a special color for special time I can Use 
[ngClass]="{green: event?.time === '8:00 am'}" or I can use [ngClass]="nameFunction(), 
and I will make that Function such as 
getStart(){
 const early = this?.event && this?.event.time === '8:00 am';
 return {green: isEarly, bold: isEarly}
}  
or I use
if(this.event && this.event.time === '8:00 am')
return 'green bold '
return ''

or Use
return ['green', 'bold']
retune []


take green in css too
